Computing limit starting from expected outcome
Will compute expected limit(s) using minimizer Minuit2 with strategy 0 and tolerance 0.01
Constraints of type SimpleGaussianConstraint: 53
Median for expected limits: 3.29688
Sigma  for expected limits: 1.68211

 -- Asymptotic -- 
Expected  2.5%: r < 1.6935
Expected 16.0%: r < 2.3010
Expected 50.0%: r < 3.2969
Expected 84.0%: r < 4.7819
Expected 97.5%: r < 6.6867
